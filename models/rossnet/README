Configure options:

  --with-ross=PATH              Specify path to ROSS instance

	This option allows you to specify the location of the ROSS instance you would like to use.

  --with-ross-seq               Enable ROSS sequential scheduler

	This option specifies to use ROSS's sequential scheduler, rather than to run in parallel,
	which would invoke the GVT routine, and mutexes.

  --with-pe                     Number of processors to use

	This option allows you to specify the number of processors to use for the simulation run.
	Specifying --with-ross-seq overrides this value to be 1.

  --with-kp                     Number of kernel processes to use

	This option allows you to specify the number of kernel processes to use during the simulation.

  --with-tcp                     Use TCP module

	This option includes the TCP module in the rossnet core.  When this is selected, space is
	allocated in ROSS events for the TCP messages, and adds the TCP function handlers to rossnet.

  --with-ospf                    Use OSPF module

	This option includes the OSPF module in the rossnet core.  When this is selected, space is
	allocated in ROSS events for the OSPF messages, and adds the OSPF function handlers to rossnet.

  --with-ftp                     Use FTP module

	This option includes the FTP module in the rossnet core.  When this is selected, space is
	allocated in ROSS events for the FTP messages, and adds the FTP function handlers to rossnet.

	TODO:

	Although there are options for the modules, they still are all getting linked in to the 
	executable.. which is unnecessary.
