# Se√±ior: Simplified ROSS

This is a simplified version of Rensselaer's Optimistic Simulation System.

Visit the main branch of ROSS [here](https://github.com/carothersc/ROSS).

Please visit [the wiki](http://github.com/gonsie/SR/wiki) for details on how SR differs from regular ROSS.


## Installation

Be sure you initialize the submodules before you try to build, otherwise you'll get a GetGitRevision error in CMake.
(TODO: make this not a requirement)

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
