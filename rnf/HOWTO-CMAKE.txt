1. Compile the ROSS Library.  At some point in the future, we will most likely
be moving ROSS under CMake.

2. Create a directory external to the rossnet directory, in this case, we will
create pdes/trunk/models/rossnet-build and cd into it.

3. Type ``export CC=mpicc'' This will tell CMake to use mpicc in place of gcc.

4. Run ``cmake ../rossnet'' This will run some scripts to determine project
dependencies.

5. Type ``make'' Everything should build correctly.

In the event something in these instructions does not work, perhaps your
ROSS/ROSSNET configurations are different (will cause problems).  If this
is the case, you may edit the ROSS Makefile, the ROSSNET CMakeLists.txt
file, or both until they agree on their options.
